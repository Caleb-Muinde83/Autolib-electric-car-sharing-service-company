#### Preparation and Analysis, 24/09/2021

#### By Caleb Muinde

## Description
We will work as a Data Scientist for the Autolib electric car-sharing service company to investigate a claim about the blue cars from the provided Autolib dataset.  In an effort to do this, we need to identify some areas and periods of interest via sampling stating the reason to the choice of method, then perform hypothesis testing with regards to the claim that we will have made. The selected periods of interest be either weekdays or weekends but not a mix of both. To work on this project, we will perform the following analysis with Python;  

1. Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset. 
2. Plot appropriate univariate and bivariate summaries recording our observations. 
3. Implement the solution by performing hypothesis testing. This will need to be documented     when writing the report. 

## Setup/Installation Requirements
1. Text editor-Atom or any text editor that supports python. If you want to interacy with the notebook offline.
2. Install Python 3.9.0.
3. Google colab for the data preparation and analysis online.
4. Load and preview data sets.

## Repository contains
1. Two datasets
2. Colab Python Notebook
3. Hypothesis report
